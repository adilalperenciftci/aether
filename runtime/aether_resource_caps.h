/* aether_resource_caps.h — runtime per-call resource caps (#343)
 *
 * Two caps for `--emit=lib` plugin-host scenarios where untrusted
 * Aether code runs inside a trusted process:
 *
 *   1. Process-wide memory cap. The atomic counter `g_mem_used`
 *      tracks current allocated bytes (NOT high-water-mark);
 *      `aether_caps_check_alloc(n)` refuses past the configured
 *      ceiling. Cap-aware allocators in std/string, std/collections,
 *      runtime/memory consult the counter before malloc/realloc and
 *      decrement via `aether_caps_account_free(n)` on free. Counter
 *      saturates at zero in release builds; debug builds assert on
 *      under-flow so accounting bugs surface early.
 *
 *   2. Per-thread wall-clock deadline. `aether_caps_set_deadline_ms`
 *      records `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) + ms` in TLS;
 *      `aether_caps_deadline_tripped()` is the codegen-emitted
 *      tripwire that compares to NOW at every loop head and at the
 *      mailbox-receive in actor handlers. Deadline-tripped state is
 *      sticky — once `__aether_abort_call()` flips the TLS flag,
 *      every subsequent tripwire check returns 1 until the host
 *      explicitly clears the deadline by setting a new one.
 *
 * Public C surface (libaether.h) wraps the symbols below in
 * commit 2/3 (libaether_caps.c). Codegen emits direct calls to
 * `aether_caps_deadline_tripped` + `__aether_abort_call` only
 * when --emit=lib is active (commit 3/3).
 *
 * Fast path: when no cap is set, every check is one branch + one
 * relaxed atomic load. Hot-path cost ≈ 1 ns.
