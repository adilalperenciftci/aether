// Go-style panic / recover for Aether actors.
//
// Surface:
//   - User code:   panic("reason") unwinds via aether_panic().
//                  try { ... } catch e { ... } codegens to a push + sigsetjmp
//                  pair; the catch body runs with `e` bound to the reason.
//   - Scheduler:   wraps each actor step() in a sigsetjmp barrier using the
//                  same push/pop primitives. On longjmp, the actor is marked
//                  dead and the on_actor_death hook fires. Other actors
//                  keep running.
//   - Signals:     AETHER_CATCH_SIGNALS=1 at process start installs
//                  SIGSEGV/SIGFPE/SIGBUS handlers that convert native faults
//                  into aether_panic(). Off by default because a native
//                  fault mid-enqueue can leave runtime state inconsistent.
//
// Nested try is supported via a per-thread stack of frames. Each try / each
// scheduler step() wrapper pushes one frame on entry and pops on normal exit
// or after catching.
//
// The scheduler and codegen both construct the pattern manually at the call
// site — sigsetjmp must lexically enclose the work being guarded, so we
// can't wrap it in a helper function. aether_try_push() returns a pointer
// to the newly-allocated frame; the caller then calls sigsetjmp(frame->buf, 1).

// The step-level panic barrier runs on every actor step, so it has to
// be cheap. Plain register-save setjmp/longjmp is a handful of
// instructions on modern CPUs. The signal-mask-preserving variants —
// sigsetjmp(buf, 1) and macOS's default setjmp() — call
// sigprocmask under the hood, which is a syscall plus context switch,
// orders of magnitude more expensive per call. On a message-heavy
// benchmark that invokes the barrier on every actor step, paying the
// signal-mask variant per step is a large regression end-to-end. Run
// benchmarks/cross-language/aether/ping_pong after any change in this
// area to verify.
//
// So:
//   - POSIX (Linux, macOS, BSDs): use _setjmp/_longjmp explicitly.
//     Both are in POSIX.1-2001 XSI, and they skip the signal-mask
//     save unconditionally. This is the fast path.
//   - mingw-w64 x86_64: _setjmp(buf, NULL), the non-unwinding form (see
//     its arm below for why the default SEH-unwinding setjmp is wrong here).
//   - Other Windows / Emscripten / newlib and picolibc (ESP-IDF) /
//     freestanding: plain setjmp/longjmp. Win32 has no POSIX signal
//     semantics so setjmp is already fast; wasm and the embedded libcs
//     have no sigjmp_buf at all, and the embedded ones no _longjmp.
//
// What we lose: signal-mask preservation during the opt-in
// AETHER_CATCH_SIGNALS=1 SIGSEGV-recovery path. That path is already
// documented as "best-effort, not production-safe" (a SIGSEGV mid-
// enqueue can leave queue state inconsistent), and user-code
// panic() / try / catch doesn't need signal-mask semantics at all.
//
// The aether_sigjmp_buf typedef stays so call sites read uniformly;
// on every target it's now jmp_buf under the hood.

  /* wasm32-wasi has NO usable setjmp/longjmp, in either spelling.
   *
   * WASI is hosted (__STDC_HOSTED__ == 1) and does not define
   * __EMSCRIPTEN__, so without this arm it falls into the POSIX branch below
   * and gets _setjmp/_longjmp -- which wasi-libc declares but never
   * implements. That is a LINK error, not a compile error, so it surfaces
   * only at the very end of a cross build:
   *
   *     wasm-ld: error: libaether.a(aether_panic.o): undefined symbol: _longjmp
   *
   * The plain setjmp/longjmp arm is no better: wasi-libc's <setjmp.h> is a
   * hard `#error` telling you to compile with `-mllvm -wasm-enable-sjlj` and
   * use an engine implementing the exception-handling proposal. Measured on
   * zig 0.16.0, passing that flag does not help either -- the #error fires
   * before the pass ever runs. Real support needs the WebAssembly
   * exception-handling proposal in both toolchain and engine.
   *
   * So: do not unwind. SETJMP always takes the first-return arm, and LONGJMP
   * traps.
   *
   * THE CONSEQUENCE, PLAINLY: on wasi, panic() / try / catch are fail-stop
   * rather than recoverable -- a panic traps the instance instead of
   * unwinding to the nearest catch. That is a real semantic reduction, and
   * it is documented in docs/build-system.md alongside the target's other
   * caveats.
   *
   * It is still strictly better than the alternative, which is that wasi
   * cannot link at all. Nothing silently mis-executes: abort() is a trap the
   * host observes, not a fallthrough into a half-unwound stack. A catch block
   * that never runs is visible; one that runs on a corrupt stack is not. */
