# The pure TLS client with a CSPRNG that fails (#3293): a failed draw must
# fail the handshake, never leave a key share, the client random or the
# session id as the zeros of a buffer the generator did not fill.
#
# rngfail.ae links rng_fail_shim.c (aether.toml), which stands in front of
# the OS CSPRNG and fails every draw after the first N. It connects once
# with every draw let through, counting them (D), then once for each N in
# 0..D-1; listener.ae reports what each connect sent. The verdict: no
# ClientHello with an all-zero random or session id, at least one connect
# refused for want of randomness, and the free one a real ClientHello.
#
# Where the CSPRNG cannot fail (macOS and the BSDs: arc4random_buf) the
# test reports a skip.
