# WebSocket CLIENT loopback: dial the shipped WS server and round-trip.
#
# std.http had a complete RFC 6455 server but nothing that ORIGINATES a
# connection, so a ws:// endpoint was unreachable
# (asks/websocket-client-for-bidi.md — WebDriver-BiDi is transported over a
# socket the client opens).
#
# The peer here is deliberately the server side of the SAME stack: that is
# what proves interoperability rather than self-consistency. In particular a
# client MUST mask every frame it sends and a server MUST NOT (RFC 6455 §5.3),
# so an echo that comes back intact is evidence the masking is right — a
# wrongly-masked frame would reach the server as garbage.
