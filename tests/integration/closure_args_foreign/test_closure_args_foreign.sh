# A call borrows its arguments (R3), whoever compiled the closure it calls
# (#2499). A closure can come from outside the program: a box a host bridge
# or another library made, recovered with `unbox_closure` or by passing a
# `ptr` to an `fn` slot; a closure an extern returns; one C passes to a
# @c_callback; one C stores in a struct the program reads (an extern struct,
# a struct an extern fills, a raw pointer viewed as such a struct); and in a
# library build, whatever the host passes to an exported function. C that
# keeps an argument copies it, as an extern does (R4), so in each case the
# owned argument is freed after the call, as in the control program.
