# #2683: `helper = helper() + 1`, a local named after the function its own
# initializer calls, got three different answers: `ae check` of the module on
# its own passed, the same code in a main file passed the checker and failed
# in gcc ("called object 'helper' is not a function", since a C declaration
# is in scope in its own initializer), and an importing program failed with
# E0301 "Undefined function 'helper'" (the merge left the call unrenamed).
#
# A local's scope starts after its initializer: the call is the function's,
# every later `helper` the local's. Each path now builds and runs that way,
# with the shapes around it: a function value passed before the binding, a
# local bound in both arms of an if (declared ahead of them), a closure local
# whose body calls the function, a compound assignment to the local, and C
# names that differ from the Aether one (`list.size` is `list_size`, an
# `@extern`, a selective import). A call through the local after its binding
# is an error that says the local hides the function.
